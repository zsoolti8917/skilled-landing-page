## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

 To be honest i did not learn new things, i just practiced what i already know. I think i am getting better at CSS, but i still have a lot to learn.

### Continued development

I think this project is finished, maybe i will come back later and redo this project in React.
